target-blank-vulnerability
==================================================
A small script to help against the target="_blank" vulnerability

In case you never heard of this vulnerability before (like me only one day ago), read 
[this](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/256-targetblank---the-most-underestimated-vulnerability-ever/).
There are several other sites to this theme, but overall everybody says the same: 
add
````
rel="noopener noreferrer"
````
to your links if you use target="_blank". If you are to lazy to do it manually (like me again)
here is a little script which grab all links on your page with this attribute, who have no
rel="noopener noreferrer" and add it on your behalf. Still, doing it yourself in your
html-files is still the safest route to take!

How to use
----------------------------------------------
Just add the target-blank-vulnerability(.min).js at the very bottom of your page.
No more actions needed.
